This is a music productivity app to help musicians store data on music they know how to play and keep track of music they want to learn in the future.
This app is built with HTML/CSS, React, Node.js and PostgreSQL.

**Branch v1** – A basic rough draft of the app using React and JSX. No other tooling was used.

**Branch v2** – Will be the second version of the app with more advanced features and tooling including WebPack, Redux, Babel and react-router
