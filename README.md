# node_express_boilerplate

Boilerplate for starting Express projects. This is a work in progress and not set in stone as I'm still trying to establish the best file structure for projects. 

## Usage

1. Clone this repo into your new project folder `$ https://github.com/wyattsweet/node_express_boilerplate.git .`

- Delete the .git directory

- Update package.json

- Run `$ npm install ` 

## Auto compile and reload sass

Make the bin files executable â€“

```
chmod +x bin/build-css
chmod +x bin/watch-css
```
Start watching and auto compiling the sass file by running `$ npm run watch-css`
